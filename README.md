Please always sync with the master branch before doing anyworkSome useful links <br/>


'git branch'  see what branch you are in <br/>
'git checkout branch-to-go' switch to another local branch <br/>
'git pull origin main' get most up-to-date version from master main <br/>
'git add .' stage your recent work <br/>
'git commit' commit your work to local repo <br/>
'git push' push to GitHub <br/>

remember, always push into your branch only! <br/>
after that, you can send a request to merge into the main <br/>
which will of course, needs approval from project owner (me) <br/>
make sure only merge runnable version and that is: <br/>
  always 'ng serve' first before push and merge <br/>

to sum up, everytime you work on project you are *responsible!!* to do the following: <br/>
'git checkout <frontend or backend>' <br/>
'git pull origin main' <br/>
'git push' <br/>
start working on your part....

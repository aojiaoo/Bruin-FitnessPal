Please always sync with the master branch before doing anywork
Some useful links:

'git branch'  see what branch you are in
'git checkout branch-to-go' switch to another local branch
'git pull origin main' get most up-to-date version from master main
'git add .' stage your recent work
'git commit' commit your work to local repo
'git push' push to GitHub

remember, always push into your branch only!
after that, you can send a request to merge into the main
which will of course, needs approval from project owner (me)
make sure only merge runnable version and that is:
  always 'ng serve' first before push and merge
